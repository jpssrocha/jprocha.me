from here (Brazil), Russia, China, India, South Africa, UAE, Iran, and others

African delegation, more specifically from mr. Happy (his name is actually &ldquo;Happy&rdquo;)

    <p>Well &hellip; according to the voices of my head i was supposed to write about
science and tech here &hellip; But i discovered something cool in the intervals of
discussions about science and tech these day. It happened that there was a BRICS
meeting at my institute about the collaborations in HPC and AI, so we had people
from here (Brazil), Russia, China, India, South Africa, UAE, Iran, and others
that i didn&rsquo;t interacted. The coolest cultural stuff i learned was from the South
African delegation, more specifically from mr. Happy (his name is actually &ldquo;Happy&rdquo;)
he mentioned the &ldquo;Clicking languages&rdquo; of South Africa that uses clicking sounds,
mainly used by the Zulu and Xhosa people.</p>
<p>It happens that there exists languages in Africa, the Khoisan family of
languages, that uses a system of clicking sounds as phonetic sounds, from
which the Zulu and Xhosa people absorbed some influence in it&rsquo;s own languages,
resulting on the clicking sounds they have today for the &ldquo;c&rdquo;, &ldquo;x&rdquo; and &ldquo;q&rdquo;
letters, as well as the &ldquo;p&rdquo; letter for the Zulu. These sounds make for very
distinctive sounding words.</p>
<p>According to mr. Happy, the Xhosa and Zulu people in South Africa you like
you more if you can make these sounds while talking hehe But then you&rsquo;ll need
something different for the other 9 languages there since there are 11!</p>
