Hi, I'm Jo√£o Pedro Rocha, a Masters Student of Scientific Computing at LNCC
(National Laboratory for Scientific Computing, :brazil:). 


I'm from a Physics background and am now developing research in Scientific
Machine Learning, with Physics Informed Neural Networks applied to Transport
Phenomena for nuclear reactor safety. 

I also do some work with Astrophysical data processing, mainly photometrical
time series, acquired with the telescopes managed by the LNA (National Astrophysics
Laboratory, also :brazil:).


Here i share about the stuff i learn along the way so that who are interested
can take advantage from it and we can interact about it (you can find my social
networks on the [main page](/)!). 


Here you will find:


- [TIL](/til/): Nuggets of knowledge learned on a given day.
- [Projects](/project/): Some info about the projects I'm currently in.
- [Blog](/posts/): Long form knowledge nugget.

If you want to see my cv you can find it on:
