+++

The physics of flying cows is a really interesting subject, which is
very important for the economy, given that their poop can fertilize 
entire fields in an efficient air bone manner. 

Nevertheless they can also be a problem when flying cows flyes over 
cities, since they can fall on business places growing the business 
expenses on poop cleaning, given that they already have their own to
clean, this process is quite inefficient.
