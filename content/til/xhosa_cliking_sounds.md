title = 'Xhosa-Zulu Cliking Sounds'
+++

Well ... according to the voices of my head i was supposed to write about
science and tech here ... But i discovered something cool in the intervals of
discussions about science and tech these day. It happened that there was a BRICS
meeting at my institute about the collaborations in HPC and AI, so we had people
from here (Brazil), Russia, China, India, South Africa, UAE, Iran, and others
that i didn't interacted. The coolest cultural stuff i learned was from the South
African delegation, more specifically from mr. Happy (his name is actually "Happy")
he mentioned the "Clicking languages" of South Africa that uses clicking sounds,
mainly used by the Zulu and Xhosa people.

It happens that there exists languages in Africa, the Khoisan family of
languages, that uses a system of clicking sounds as phonetic sounds, from
which the Zulu and Xhosa people absorbed some influence in it's own languages,
resulting on the clicking sounds they have today for the "c", "x" and "q"
letters, as well as the "p" letter for the Zulu. These sounds make for very
distinctive sounding words.

According to mr. Happy, the Xhosa and Zulu people in South Africa you like
you more if you can make these sounds while talking hehe But then you'll need
something different for the other 9 languages there since there are 11!
